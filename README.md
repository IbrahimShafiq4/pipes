# Pipes Project: Basic Setup üöÄ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Welcome to the Pipes Project Basic Setup! This project will guide you through the fundamentals of using pipes in Angular. Follow the steps below to get started:

## Getting Started

Install Dependencies: Run npm i to download the necessary dependencies, including node_modules and other files.

Run Development Server: Launch the development server by running ng serve -o (or ng s --o). Navigate to http://localhost:4200/ in your browser. The app will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source files.

## Covered Topics
Throughout this project, you will explore various aspects of using pipes in Angular. Here's a summary of what you'll learn:

01 - Built-in Pipes: Utilizing Angular's built-in pipes for common data transformations such as date formatting, number formatting, and uppercase/lowercase conversions.

02 - Custom Pipes: Creating custom pipes to perform custom data transformations tailored to your application's specific needs.

03 - Async Pipes: Using the async pipe to handle asynchronous data streams and automatically subscribe and unsubscribe from observables.

04 - Pure vs. Impure Pipes: Understanding the difference between pure and impure pipes and when to use each type.

05 - Chaining Pipes: Chaining multiple pipes together to apply multiple transformations to data.

06 - Parameterized Pipes: Passing parameters to pipes to customize their behavior.

07 - Pipe Composition: Composing pipes together to create more complex data transformations.

08 - Error Handling: Handling errors gracefully when using pipes and providing fallback values or error messages.

### By working through this project, you'll gain a solid understanding of using pipes in Angular and be well-equipped to perform various data transformations in your applications.
